##Welcome!

After promising this for several weekends, I'm happy to say that the first published beta of this site is now live.

The original aim of this site was to be able to send feedback to Southeastern, easily, without having to repeatedly fill out your data each time you wanted to send a new comment.

I've also added support for storing your personal data required for a Delay Repay claim.

As detailed [here]({{ site.url }}/about.html) this site stores none of your data, it is stored directly in your browser.

There's still a few tweaks that I need to make to the site to make data work across the customer feedback and delay repay sites work better (you'll see that departure/arrival/ticket type doesn't get stored across both sites - since Southeastern's site uses different values on each page)
