##So you're on the train, and you want to contact your train company

They don't make it easy. The forms have a number of required fields that you need to enter each time before you can send your comment.

Worse still, if you want to make a delay claim, you have to enter the same details about yourself, and your ticket each time, in order to submit your delay.

Ultimately, the chances are that you would just not bother, which is what the train company wants you to do.  They'd rather not have to deal with your questions, or give you money for delays.

##Twitter?

Yes, twitter exists, most, if not all, Train Operating Companies have a presence on twitter.  However, the communication via this medium does not form part of their statistics, and they are under no obligation to reply to you.

In many cases, they just pass your feedback on to the appropriate team - with no return path as to what the team plan to do.

##Welcome to trains.wtf

This site was put together as a quick proof of concept of something I've been thinking about for a while when wanting to complain to my train company, which was awoken by a tweet from @Percinio recently about a way to easily submit comments

##How the site works

You fill in your details for a delay or customer feedback.

You hit submit. This then populates the train company's website with your details and feedback, or delay claim.

You verify that the content is correct, and in the case of a delay claim, upload an image of your ticket.

You submit your feedback to the train company

##But...what's the benefit?

Try it and see, fill in some details. Close your browser/browser tab. Come back to the page.

Your details are still there!

Which means...you fill in your details once, and then just customise what is pertinent - comments, or details about your journey.

##Are you storing my data?

No, not at all. Your browser is.

This site has no access to it, and has no intention to! Since, for that, I'd need a server resource.

So, rest assured, your data is protected as long as your browser/devices are secured.
